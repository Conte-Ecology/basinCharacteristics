PRISM Climate Data
==================

This script produces rasters of climate variables based on the PRISM Climate Dataset. Temperature rasters are in degrees C and precipitation rasters are in mm.

## Steps to Run:

The folder structure is set up within the scripts. In general, the existing structure in the repo should be followed. Raw data should be unzipped, but otherwise kept in the same format as it is downloaded.

1. Open the script `prism`

2. Change the values in the "Specify inputs" section of the script
 - `baseDirectory` is the path to the `prism` folder
 - `catchmentsFilePath` is the file path to the catchments polygons shapefile. (See "Notes" section)
 - `rasterFilePath` is the file path to the raw climate raster (`.asc` format)
 - `version` is the name that will be associated with this particular run of the tool (e.g. "NortheastHRD" for all High Resolution Catchments)

3. Run the script in ArcPython. It does the following:
   - Sets up the folder structure in the specified directory
   - Generates the processing boundary from the specified shapefile and clips the source raster to this range
   - Trims the raw raster to the spatial boundary 
   - Saves the completed rasters to the `prism\gisFiles\Northeast\outputFiles` directory
   
## Output Rasters

#### Average Minimum Annual Temperature
Raster name: ann_tmin_c <br>
Description: This layer represents the 30-year normal (1981-2010) of average minimum annual temperature.

#### Average Maximum Annual Temperature
Raster name: ann_tmax_c <br>
Description: This layer represents the 30-year normal (1981-2010) of average maximum annual temperature.

#### Average Monthly Precipition (12 rasters)
Raster names: e.g. jan_prcp_mm, feb_prcp_mm, mar_prcp_mm, apr_prcp_mm, may_prcp_mm, jun_prcp_mm, jul_prcp_mm, aug_prcp_mm, sep_prcp_mm, oct_prcp_mm, nov_prcp_mm, dec_prcp_mm <br>
Description: These layers represents the 30-year normal (1981-2010) of average monthly precipitaion.



## Notes

- Typically, the `catchmentsFilePath` variable specifies a shapefile of hydrologic catchments defining the range over which the "Zonal Statistics" tool will be applied. It is possible to enter another polygon shapefile, such as state or town boundaries, as this variable. The primary purpose of this file is to trim the original raster, which represents the continental US, to a manageable size.

## Next Steps

- Additional climate variables, available from the PRISM website, can be processed in the same manner.
