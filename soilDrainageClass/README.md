Soil Drainage Class
===================

This script produces a spatial dataset of the soil drainage class of the soil based on the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO). The qualitiative classification are reclassified to numeric values (ranging from 1 to 7) for spatial averaging. 


## Data Sources
| Layer   | Source                                                | Link                                                           |
|:-----:  | ------                                                | ----                                                           |

## Steps to Run:

The folder structure is set up within the scripts. In general, the existing structure in the repo should be followed. Raw data should be kept in the same format as it is downloaded.

1. Download the data by state and unzip the sub-folder (e.g. `soils\gssurgo_g_ma.zip`  into the `sourceFolder` directory

2. Open the script `soilDrainageClass.py`

3. Change the values in the "Specify inputs" section of the script
 - `baseDirectory` is the path to the `\soilDrainageClass` folder (current parent working directory)
 - `states` is the list of state abbreviations included in the desired range
 - `sourceFolder` is the source folder of the wetlands datasets by state
 - `outputName` is the name that will be associated with this particular run of the tool (e.g. "Northeast")

4. Run the script in ArcPython. It does the following:
   - Sets up the folder structure in the specified directory
   - Merges the necessary data tables in order to connect spatial data to necessary soil classification
   - Loops through the state polygons, creating state rasters of the drainage class
   - Converts the drainage class categories to numeric values according to the table in the next section
   - Mosaicks all of the state rasters to output a single raster
   - Saves the completed rasters to the `soilDrainageClass\gisFiles\Northeast\outputFiles` directory
   
## Reclassification Values

   |        Drainage Class       | Assigned Value |
   |:---------------------------:| -------------- |
   | Excessively drained         |      1         |
   | Somewhat excessively drained|      2         |
   | Well drained                |      3         |
   | Moderately well drained     |      4         |
   | Somewhat poorly drained     |      5         |
   | Poorly drained              |      6         |
   | Very poorly drained         |      7         |


## Output Rasters

#### Soil Drainage Class
Raster name: drainageclass <br>
Description: This layer is a numeric representation of the soil drainage class. This category is defined in the Drainage Class ("drainagecl") column of SSURGO's Component table ("component").


## Notes

- The spatial range is determined by the list of states specified.
