basinCharacteristics
====================

Contains the scripts, procedures and some of the ouputs for the basin characteristics generated in the models and maps. Currently the dataset is based on the NHDplus medium res delineation.

## fwsWetlands
Creates the raster layers that describe the presence of wetlands.

## impoundedArea
Creates the raster layers that describe the presence of "impounded" waterbodies.

## impoundments
Calculates the distance, surface area, and contributing drainage area to each waterbody on the stream network.

## surficialCoarseness
Creates the raster layer indicating the surficial geology that is described as coarse.

## zonalStatistics

Calcuates spatial averages of the raster layers across a specified shapefile containing catchment polygons.
